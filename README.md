BOSS
====

Tell your JavaScript functions when to work.
--------------------------------------------

Boss is a task queue which runs asynchronous functions in serial or parallel.
It reports on progress by emitting events, which can be listened for and
handled by the caller.

This is cool for testing, building, and deployment scripts.
